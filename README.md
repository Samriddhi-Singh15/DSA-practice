# ðŸ§  DSA Practice â€“ Arrays & HashMaps

Hey there! I'm Samriddhi Singh, and this repository contains my basic DSA practice in Python.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside
- 20+ beginner-level problems
- Topics: Arrays and HashMaps
- Solved using clean and efficient Python code

## ðŸ“Œ How It's Organized
All problems are currently in one file:
- `arrays_hashmap_practice.py`

Each solution is written separately and includes:
- A simple function name
- Clear logic
- No unnecessary extras ðŸ˜Œ

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo Exists
This is part of my journey toward becoming a better programmer.  
I'm practicing core data structures and pushing my progress to GitHub to build accountability.

Stay tuned â€” more DSA topics coming soon!
